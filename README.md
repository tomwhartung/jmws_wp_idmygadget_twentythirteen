# jmws_twentythirteen_idMyGadget

Adding the device detection provided by IdMyGadget to the default Wordpress theme twentythirteen.

## Introduction

This is the WordPress default theme Twentythirteen with IdMyGadget device detection added in.

I did not care for the way Twentyfifteen looked so am thinking I will give this a shot.

## Differences Between This Theme and Twentyfifteen

The goal is to add options similar to those added to joomla.  This is a work in progress.

## FAQ

1. About the extra phone header/footer nav options

First off, the phone nav only looks good on phones.
Hence the name: *Phone* Header/Footer Nav.
I designed the options so that you can see them on tablets and desktops and judge for yourself.
Who am I to predict the use cases you will want to satisfy?

## Specific Changes Made
